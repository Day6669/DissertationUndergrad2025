Mr Rutte indicated that Nato accepted President Trump’s analysis that member states need to spend 5 per cent of their total GDP on defence.<br><br>

Standing alongside Sir Keir at a press conference at the Nato headquarters in Brussels, Mr Rutte said Nato countries had increased defence spending by 18 per cent over the last year. But he warned that the alliance’s current 2 per cent spending target would have to be increased.<br><br>
<img src="Nato_s_Secretary_General_Mark_Rutte.avif" alt="General Mark Rutte" class="news-image">
‘In a more dangerous world, 2 per cent will not be enough to keep us safe,’ he said. ‘We need to invest considerably more.’<br><br>

Mr Trump has demanded that Nato countries increase defence spending after years of relying on the US.<br><br>

Sir Keir acknowledged the need for European Nato members to ‘shoulder more of the burden now’. He said the UK was already spending 2.3 per cent of its GDP on defence and insisted he was ‘working hard to set a path to 2.5 per cent’.<br><br>

Labour committed to the 2.5 per cent target before the general election but has torn up a Tory timetable to meet it by the end of the decade. A new strategic defence review is currently underway. But tight public finances have led the Treasury to propose delaying the target until 2032. At a dinner with EU leaders last night, Sir Keir said European states needed to improve collaboration in the face of increasing global threats.<br><br>

The Prime Minister highlighted the risk of Russia targeting vital undersea cables around Europe’s coastline. ‘We need to deepen cooperation to protect ourselves from state threat and sabotage, including on subsea infrastructure,’ Sir Keir said.<br><br>

‘We need to improve military mobility and logistics across Europe so that we can move troops and material more easily to where they need to be.’ Mr Rutte played down suggestions that Mr Trump’s demand to take Greenland from Denmark could splinter the Nato alliance, saying there were ‘always issues between allies’. Mr Trump’s early interventions since winning the White <br><br>

‘In a more dangerous world’<br><br>

House have raised concerns among Nato countries.<br><br>

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said it would ‘be a cruel paradox if, during the time of this direct Russian threat and Chinese expansion’, the EU and the US ended up in a ‘conflict among allies’. But Mr Rutte said the idea that Europe could act independently from the US on defence was a ‘silly thought for so many reasons’. ‘This is a geopolitical thing playing out at the moment with Ukraine,’ he added.<br><br>

‘The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises it. The US is also under threat now with the... long-range missiles coming out of North Korea, maybe in the future, thanks to all the technology the Russians are delivering. So, for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist.<br><br>

‘I absolutely believe that the best thing the West can do is to stay united, and I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US.’
