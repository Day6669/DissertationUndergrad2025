                        KEIR Starmer last night vowed to continue trying to unpick Brexit - despite warnings Britain will be dragged into a damaging trade war with the United States. <br><br>
                        In a dramatic move which caused turmoil on global markets yesterday, Donald Trump threatened heavy trade tariffs against the EU, describing the bloc's conduct as 'an atrocity. But he suggested the UK
                        Senior Tories urged the Prime Minister to abandon his reset' with Brussels and focus on securing a new trade deal with the US.
                        
                        But speaking ahead of a dinner with EU leaders last night, GLOBAL markets tumbled yesterday over fears of a trade war after Donald Trump imposed huge tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. But the pound rallied against the euro - driven by hopes that while the European Union may be next in Mr Trump's sights, Brexit Britain could be spared <br><br>
                        
                        It followed the US president saying the EUs behaviour was an 'atrocity’ and that while the UK was 'out of line... that one can be worked out?’ <br><br>
                        <img src="Trump.png" alt="Trump and ball of worms agency text" class="news-image">
                        After Mr Trump's comments, referencing trade deficits, the FTSE 100 slid by as much as 1.8 per cent, or 154 points, wiping £38billion off its value. Stocks in the US, Europe and Asia were also sharply down. <br><br>
                        
                        The turbulence erupted after Mr Trump announced tariffs of 25 per cent on imports from America's neighbours Mexico and Canada over the weekend, as well as a 10 per cent charge on Chinese goods.<br><br>
                        
                        The markets partially recovered after reports the President had agreed to pause tariffs on Mexico.
                        And following a phone call with Mr Trump last night, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said the proposed tariffs on his country would be paused for at least 30 days too.<br><br>
                        
                        Economists said the tariffs would hit not just the countries directly involved, but threatened a wider trade war. This would slow the global economy as well as inflict higher prices on Americans. Even Mr Trump admitted the move could cause pain.
                        George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank said if the tariffs went ahead it would represent the largest shock in grobal trade policy since the 1970s - even bigger than the trade war against China launched by Mr Trump during his first term. 'These tariffs are roughly five times as large as the cumulative sum of trade actions taken under the first Trump administration, Mr Sara-velos said. The apparent pause in tariffs against Mexico and Canada for a month followed
                        Talks with the countries' leaders, during which they agreed to each send 10,000 troops to help police their borders with the US.<br><br>
                        
                        The FTSE100 closed 1 per cent, or 90 points down at 8584. But it was still a bleak start to February after the blue-chip index enjoyed its strongest month for more than two years in January, ending on a record high last Friday.
                        Meanwhile, Germany's Dax fell 1.4 per cent while France's Cac 40 lost 1.2 per cent and Japan's Nikkei fell
                        2.7 per cent. US stocks were not immune. The S&P500 index opened 1.2 per cent down and the Nasdaq lost an initial 2.1 per cent.
                        Fears Mr Trump would hit Europe rose after he lamented the fact it sells more goods to the US than the
                        US sells to it. Mr Trump said: 'They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them."<br><br>
                        
                        EU leaders yesterday warned Mr Trump they would fight back if necessary. At an informal summit in Brussels, French president Emmanuel Macron said if the EU were targeted it would have to make itself respected and thus react. And German chancellor Olaf Scholz said the bloc could respond with its own tariffs on the US, but was seeking agreement.<br>
                        EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said if a trade war broke out between the bloc and the US, then the one laughing on the side is China. Last night Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: 'What's really important is open and strong trading relations.<br><br>
                        
                        "That's been the basis of my discussions with President Trump and I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.’
